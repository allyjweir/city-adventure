Design Notes
----
- This app has been designed to fit in with Google's Material Design stylings fit for the Android platform.
- Designed using Sketch on OSX.


Fonts
----
For the project name and other key headlines use Pacifico. This can be found in this folder or on Google Fonts. Otherwise use the standard Roboto


Colour Palette
----
These should be used throughout the application. I used Adobe Color CC to get this Analogous range. It listed the Orange as the primary but I would tend to using the Purple or Blue as the key colour.
34FF25 - Green
E8C52E - Yellow (Gold-like?)
FF6635 - Orange
B925E8 - Purple
288DFF - Blue
